# Dog_Adoption_DataAnalysis

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is gain insights on dog adoption situation in USA and answer the following questions:
- What types and breed of dog are brought into shelters across the USA in a given year?
- Which states have the most dogs in shelters and what breeds/types those are? Does it have anything to do with the population in each states?
- Are there any trends in the types/breeds of dogs being brought into shelters?

## Project Description
This project was motivated by my love for dog and my passion to improve the dog adoption process. The data used in here was obtained from [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/dog-adoption).

Information about the data: This dataset of adoptable dogs in the US was collected to better understand how animals are relocated from state to state and imported from outside the US. The data includes information on over 3,000 dogs that were described as having originated in places different from where they were listed for adoption. The findings were published in a visual essay on The Pudding entitled Finding Forever Homes published in October 2019. This dataset is a snapshot of data collected on a single day and does not include all adoptable dogs in the US. However, it provides valuable insights into the whereabouts of these animals and the journey they take to find their forever homes [Source: Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/dog-adoption)

### Three main questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. What types and breed of dog are brought into shelters across the USA in a given year?
2. Which states have the most dogs in shelters and what breeds/types those are? Does it have anything to do with the population in each states?
3. Are there any trends in the types/breeds of dogs being brought into shelters?
